<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
<h5>Q: Actually, what is this app for?</h5>
<p><strong>A: </strong>Seeing the northern lights, although is a beautiful experience, almost always requires you to get out of the cosy and warm home, to that unbelievable, hostile, frosty, cold environment awaiting outside. What a misery it is, when you spend half of the evening, freezing outside, in a hope for even half a glimpse and nothing is there! Ha - ha! I've got a app for that! By inputing your location, or even better, any location - you can easily see what will be the level of magnetic activity in hour from now - enough to prepare those extra warm socks and underwear and charge your camera batteries! For those who are trembling inside, when they see the temperature dropping below zero (yes, that's me <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>) - we have an Instagram-alike part of the app too! See wonderful pictures of auroras made by users who were lucky enough to see it and come back alive from those unfriendly, cold lands.</p>
<h5>Q: Ok, how do you know if I'll see the aurora or not?</h5>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Check the data, aaaa!</p>
<h5>Q: I'll sue you, I have frozen my butt off and was nowhere near to an aurora!</h5>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Well, as like with every <em>forecast</em> ever, it's a... forecast. By using and analysing data we can only and <em>only</em> hypothesise that you'll see aurora, we cannot guarantee this, I'm sorry! There is such thing as probability, but... well, there's always a slight chance that somethng goes wrong. All complaints, therefore, should be sent to NASA, as the ACE Spacecraft belongs to them. </p>
