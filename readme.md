# project-1

My fist full stack application - checking the forecast for Aurora Borealis occurence. 

## How to install:

* Download or clone the repo
* ```yarn install``` or ```npm i``` to install dependencies
* gulp to compile the source code and open in browser
* Note: You'll need to have gulp-cli installed globally ```npm i -g gulp-cli```
* the game is deployed on Heroku too ([here!](http://peaceful-peak-78688.herokuapp.com/))

## Description

Well... I know just a few people who truly love winter. Seeing the northern lights, although is a beautiful experience, almost always requires you to get out of the cosy and warm home, to that unbelievable, hostile, frosty, cold environment awaiting outside. What a misery it is, when you spend half of the evening, freezing outside, in a hope for even half a glimpse and nothing is there! Ha - ha! I've got a app for that! By inputing your location, or even better, _any location_ -  you can easily see what will be the level of magnetic activity in hour from now - enough to prepare those extra warm socks and underwear and charge your camera batteries! 
For those who are trembling inside, when they see the temperature dropping below zero (yes, that's me) - we have an Instagram-alike part of the app too! See wonderful pictures of auroras made by users who were lucky enough to see it and come back alive from those unfriendly, cold lands.

## Technologies used:

* HTML 5

* jQuery 3.10
* Gulp
* Yarn
* Git & github
* JSON
* AJAX
* nodeJS
* GoogleMaps API

* first time I've used Balsamiq, does it count? [my super sweet wireframe](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/wdi27/Alex+makes+an+app.png)

## Challenges faced:

* GoogleMaps API turned out to be much more complicated that I thought - thanks to all people who helped me all the way through <3 !
* Had to actually learn how auroras occur. I know, it's embarrasing to admit that, but transparency and so on... I am super happy that I challenged myself though!

## Improvements:

* Definitely want to do forecast for couple of days ahead.
